__The knowledge of cloned rice genes lost in the information of rice functional genomic studies__

## Introdution
More than 2204 cloned rice genes and 303 gene families comprised of 3381 genes were collected. For each gene, 
various information concerning the gene symbol, the genomic locus in the Nipponbare reference genome, 
the Genbank accession number, the title, journal, year, author affiliation, abstract of related 
publications and the text mining result of the publications were provided.

    
## How to query this database?

This database was designed as a Shiny application and was deployed in the [Cloud](http://www.shinyapps.io/). 
You can query this database [HERE](https://ricencode.shinyapps.io/RICENCODE/).
You can query this database using the genomic locus assigned by the [Rice Genome Annotation Project](http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), 
or the genomic locus assigned by the [Rice Annotation Project](http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/), or the gene symbol. 
You can retrieve the basic information of a gene, the publications on a gene, the agronomic traits associated with a gene, the connections between genes from this database.

You can also query this database by downloading the whole database to your local computer (<font color="red">highly recommended</font>). In this way, you need [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) and the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) package installed on your computer (See the [munual]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/ricencode-intro.pdf)).


## How to contribute to this database?

You can also contribute to this database by submitting information on newly cloned rice gene or new publications to this database. To do this, you need to download the database and have [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) and the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) package installed on your computer(See the [munual]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/ricencode-intro.pdf)).


## Further information
Further information concerning the details on querying and contributing to this database can be found in the [manual]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/ricencode-intro.pdf).
