## Key message
1. __inflorescence__, [BEAK LIKE SPIKELET1 is Required for Lateral Development of Lemma and Palea in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BEAK LIKE SPIKELET1 is Required for Lateral Development of Lemma and Palea in Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  BLS1 is expressed strongly in young inflorescence, specifically the young lemmas and paleas of spikelets
2. __architecture__, [BEAK LIKE SPIKELET1 is Required for Lateral Development of Lemma and Palea in Rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(BEAK LIKE SPIKELET1 is Required for Lateral Development of Lemma and Palea in Rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In bls1 mutant, floral-organ identity and floral-organ patterning are normal, and the defects occur at the stage of the lemma and palea expansion, whereas the other aspects of floral architecture and form are not affected
3. __lemma__, [Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we isolated a rice mutant, beak-shaped grain1 (bsg1), which produced beak-shaped grains of decreased width, thickness and weight with a loosely interlocked lemma and palea that were unable to close tightly, Consistent with the lemma and palea shapes, the outer parenchyma cell layers of these bsg1 tissues developed fewer cells with decreased size
4. __cell division__, [Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results suggest that BSG1 determines grain shape and size probably by modifying cell division and expansion in the grain hull
5. __grain size__, [Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Beak-shaped grain 1/TRIANGULAR HULL 1, a DUF640 gene, is associated with grain shape, size and weight in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The BSG1 mutation affected the expression of genes potentially involved in the cell cycle and GW2, an important regulator of grain size in rice
