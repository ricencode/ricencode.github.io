9. __meiotic__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
10. __meiotic__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes

12. __sterility__, [MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The null mutation of MER3 results in complete sterility without any vegetative defects

14. __pollen__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens

## Connection
1. __MER3,RCK__, __OsSPO11-1,OsTOP6A1__, [OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The crossover protein, MER3, isn't efficiently assembled onto chromosomes and the lack of bivalent suggests that crossovers are also affected in the absence of OsSPO11-1
2. __MER3,RCK__, __SDS__, [Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice%5BTitle%5D)), The Arabidopsis SDS (SOLO DANCERS) and RCK (ROCK-N-ROLLERS) genes are important for male meiosis, but it is still unknown whether they represent conserved functions in plants, We have performed phylogenetic analyses of SDS and RCK and their respective homologs, and identified their putative orthologs in poplar and rice, Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that rice SDS and RCK are expressed preferentially in young flowers, and transgenic RNAi rice lines with reduced expression of these genes exhibited normal vegetative development, but showed significantly reduced fertility with partially sterile flowers and defective pollens, Further cytological examination of male meiocytes revealed that the SDS deficiency led to defects in homolog interaction and bivalent formation in meiotic prophase I, and RCK deficiency resulted in defective meiotic crossover formation, These results indicate that rice SDS and RCK genes have similar functions to their Arabidopsis orthologs, Because rice and Arabidopsis, respectively, are members of monocots and eudicots, two largest groups of flowering plants, our results suggest that the functions of SDS and RCK are likely conserved in flowering plants,Functional conservation of the meiotic genes SDS and RCK in male meiosis in the monocot rice
3. __MER3,RCK__, __PAIR2__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes, In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
4. __MER3,RCK__, __ZEP1__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes, In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis

6. __MER3,RCK__, __PAIR2__, [MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I, The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3, On the contrary, the absence of MER3 signal in pair2 mutants indicates that PAIR2 is essential for the loading and further function of MER3
7. __MER3,RCK__, __OsRad21-4,OsREC8__, [MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I, The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3
8. __MER3,RCK__, __ZEP1__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1, Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1
9. __MER3,RCK__, __ZIP4,SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1, Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes, Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa, Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice, Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1
