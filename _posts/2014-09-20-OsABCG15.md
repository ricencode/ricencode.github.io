## Key message
1. __sterility__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on map-based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459-bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, OsABCG15, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility
2. __tapetum__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistently, histological analysis showed that osabcg15 mutants developed obvious abnormality in postmeiotic tapetum degeneration, leading to rapid degredation of young microspores
3. __anther__, [The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on map-based cloning and sequence analysis, we identified a 1,459-bp deletion in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene, OsABCG15, causing abnormal anthers and male sterility, Expression analysis showed that OsABCG15 is expressed specifically in developmental anthers from stage 8 (meiosis II stage) to stage 10 (late microspore stage), Two genes CYP704B2 and WDA1, involved in the biosynthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids for the establishment of the anther cuticle and pollen exine, were downregulated in osabcg15 mutant, suggesting that OsABCG15 may play a key function in the processes related to sporopollenin biosynthesis or sporopollenin transfer from tapetal cells to anther locules,The ATP-binding cassette transporter OsABCG15 is required for anther development and pollen fertility in rice
