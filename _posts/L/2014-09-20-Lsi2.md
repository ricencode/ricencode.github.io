1. __root__, [Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Genotypic difference in silicon uptake and expression of silicon transporter genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Immunostaining with Lsi1 and Lsi2 antibodies revealed a similar pattern of subcellular localization of these two Si transporters in both varieties; Lsi1 and Lsi2 were localized at the distal and proximal sides, respectively, of both exodermis and endodermis of the roots

1. __Lsi1~OsNIP2;1__, __Lsi2__, [An efflux transporter of silicon in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An efflux transporter of silicon in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we describe a previously uncharacterized gene, low silicon rice 2 (Lsi2), which has no similarity to Lsi1, The protein encoded by this gene is localized, like Lsi1, on the plasma membrane of cells in both the exodermis and the endodermis, but in contrast to Lsi1, which is localized on the distal side, Lsi2 is localized on the proximal side of the same cells
