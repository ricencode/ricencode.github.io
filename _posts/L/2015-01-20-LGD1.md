## Expression information

## Key message
1. __grain yield__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
2. __vegetative__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity
3. __growth__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, T-DNA mutant and RNAi transgenic approaches were used to functionally characterize a unique rice gene, LAGGING GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT 1 (LGD1), The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield, Our results demonstrated that LGD1 pleiotropically regulated rice vegetative growth and development through both the distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns of its multiple transcripts and RNA binding activity,Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters
4. __grain__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
5. __architecture__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
6. __panicle architecture__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
7. __height__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
8. __tiller number__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield, The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi-dwarfism
9. __yield__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
10. __dwarf__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi-dwarfism
11. __tiller__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield, The fewer unelongated internodes and cells in lgd1 led to respective reductions in tiller number and to semi-dwarfism
12. __panicle__, [Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice LGD1 containing RNA binding activity affects growth and development through alternative promoters%5BTitle%5D)),  The lgd1 mutant showed slow growth, reduced tiller number and plant height, altered panicle architecture and reduced grain yield
