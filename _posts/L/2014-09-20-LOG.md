## Expression information

## Key message
1. __shoot__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem, LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
2. __meristem__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  The LONELY GUY (LOG) gene of rice is required to maintain meristem activity and its loss of function causes premature termination of the shoot meristem, LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
3. __cytokinin__, [Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Direct control of shoot meristem activity by a cytokinin-activating enzyme%5BTitle%5D)),  LOG encodes a novel cytokinin-activating enzyme that works in the final step of bioactive cytokinin synthesis, Revising the long-held idea of multistep reactions, LOG directly converts inactive cytokinin nucleotides to the free-base forms, which are biologically active, by its cytokinin-specific phosphoribohydrolase activity, LOG messenger RNA is specifically localized in shoot meristem tips, indicating the activation of cytokinins in a specific developmental domain
