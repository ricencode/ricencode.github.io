## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
2. __meiosis__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
3. __meiotic__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
4. __reproductive__, [An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Mature PAIR2 mRNA and several splicing variants were found to be highly expressed in wild-type reproductive tissues, and lower expression was also detected in vegetative tissues
5. __meiotic__, [Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Central region component1, a novel synaptonemal complex component, is essential for meiotic recombination initiation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We found that CRC1 is also essential for the recruitment of PAIR2 onto meiotic chromosomes
6. __pollen__, [An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  In situ hybridization and BrdU incorporation experiments revealed that PAIR2 expression is specifically enhanced in male and female meiocytes, but not in those at pre-meiotic S phase or in the pollen maturation stages
7. __meiosis__, [PAIR2 is essential for homologous chromosome synapsis in rice meiosis I](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(PAIR2 is essential for homologous chromosome synapsis in rice meiosis I%5BTitle%5D)), The PAIR2 gene is required for homologous chromosome synapsis at meiosis I in rice (Oryza sativa L, However, PAIR2 does not play a role in AE formation, sister chromatid cohesion at centromeres or kinetochore assembly in meiosis I of rice,PAIR2 is essential for homologous chromosome synapsis in rice meiosis I

9. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal, Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
10. __vegetative__, [An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Mature PAIR2 mRNA and several splicing variants were found to be highly expressed in wild-type reproductive tissues, and lower expression was also detected in vegetative tissues
11. __meiosis__, [An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis%5BTitle%5D)), To elucidate the genetic system that establishes homologous chromosome pairing in monocot plants, we have isolated an asynaptic mutant of rice, designated pair2 (homologous pairing aberration in rice meiosis 2), in which 24 completely unpaired univalents are observed at pachytene and diakinesis, The results obtained in this study suggest that the PAIR2 gene is essential for homologous chromosome pairing in meiosis, as in the case of the genes ASY1 and HOP1,An insertional mutation in the rice PAIR2 gene, the ortholog of Arabidopsis ASY1, results in a defect in homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis

1. __OsRad21-4~OsREC8__, __PAIR2__, [OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSPO11-1 is essential for both homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Although the two axial-associated proteins, REC8 and PAIR2, are loaded onto the chromosomes, the depletion of PAIR2 from the chromosomes is much later than in wild type
2. __OsAM1__, __PAIR2__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes, In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
3. __MER3~RCK__, __PAIR2__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes, In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis

6. __OsRad21-4~OsREC8__, __PAIR2__, [MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MER3 is required for normal meiotic crossover formation, but not for presynaptic alignment in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, MER3 does not colocalize with PAIR2 at the beginning of prophase I, but locates on one end of PAIR2 fragments at later stages, whereas MER3 foci merely locate on one end of REC8 fragments when signals start to be seen in early prophase I, The normal loading of PAIR2 and REC8 in mer3 implies that their loading is independent of MER3
