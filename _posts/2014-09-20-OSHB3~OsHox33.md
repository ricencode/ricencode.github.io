## Key message
1. __meristem__, [Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  pOsHox33::GUS fusion expression and RT-PCR revealed that OsHox33 is highly expressed in young organs, especially in young meristems such as shoot apical meristems, intercalary meristems, and young callus
2. __senescence__, [Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we analyzed a HD-Zip III member, OsHox33, and demonstrated that it plays an important role in age-dependent leaf senescence in rice, Transgenic plants harboring either RNAi construct displayed similar phenotypes of precocious leaf senescence symptoms, suggesting that knockdown of OsHox33 accelerates leaf senescence in rice, Finally, real-time PCR studies showed that OsHox33 can regulate the expression of GS1 and GS2, two senescence-associated genes,Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice

7. __chloroplast__, [Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  To further investigate OsHox33 function, we analyzed chloroplast ultrastructure in different-aged leaves of RNAi plants, and found that OsHox33 knockdown accelerated chloroplast degradation, which is consistent with RNAi phenotypes
8. __intercalary meristem__, [Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of OsHox33, a member of the class III homeodomain-leucine zipper gene family, accelerates leaf senescence in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  pOsHox33::GUS fusion expression and RT-PCR revealed that OsHox33 is highly expressed in young organs, especially in young meristems such as shoot apical meristems, intercalary meristems, and young callus

10. __auxin__, [Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  The treatment of seedlings with auxin quickly induced ectopic OSHB3 expression in the entire region of the SAM, but not in other tissues
11. __resistant__, [Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Developmental role and auxin responsiveness of Class III homeodomain leucine zipper gene family members in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Plants ectopically expressing microRNA166-resistant versions of the OSHB3 gene exhibited severe defects, including the ectopic production of leaf margins, shoots, and radialized leaves"
