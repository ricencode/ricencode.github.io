## Key message
1. __floral__, [CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS1, encoding a monocot-specific MADS box protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS1, encoding a monocot-specific MADS box protein, regulates floral organ identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we characterized a MIKC-type MADS box gene, CHIMERIC FLORAL ORGANS (CFO1), which plays a key role in the regulation of floral organ identity in rice (Oryza sativa), The cfo1 mutant displayed defective marginal regions of the palea, chimeric floral organs, and ectopic floral organs, The expression domains of CFO1 were mainly restricted to the marginal region of the palea and inner floral organs, The floral organ identity gene DROOPING LEAF (DL) was expressed ectopically in all defective organs of cfo1 flowers, Double mutant analysis revealed that loss of DL function mitigated some of the defects of floral organs in cfo1 flowers, We propose that the CFO1 gene plays a pivotal role in maintaining floral organ identity through negative regulation of DL expression
