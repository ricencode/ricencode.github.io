3. __starch__, [Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (csa), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs
4. __sterile__, [Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we describe a photoperiod-controlled male sterile line, carbon starved anther (csa), which contains a mutation in an R2R3 MYB transcription regulator of pollen development, The csa-based photoperiod-sensitive male sterile line allows the establishment of a stable two-line hybrid system, which promises to have a significant impact on agriculture,Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production

6. __seed__, [Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production%5BTitle%5D)), Mutation in CSA creates a new photoperiod-sensitive genic male sterile line applicable for hybrid rice seed production

8. __stem__, [Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Carbon starved anther encodes a MYB domain protein that regulates sugar partitioning required for rice pollen development%5BTitle%5D)),  We have isolated and characterized a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant, carbon starved anther (csa), that showed increased sugar contents in leaves and stems and reduced levels of sugars and starch in floral organs
