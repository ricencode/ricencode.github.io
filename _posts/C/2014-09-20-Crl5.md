## Key message
1. __crown root__, [The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The auxin responsive AP2/ERF transcription factor CROWN ROOTLESS5 is involved in crown root initiation in rice through the induction of OsRR1, a type-A response regulator of cytokinin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we characterized a rice mutant, termed crown rootless5 (crl5), which produced fewer crown roots and displayed impaired initiation of crown root primordia, The expression of CRL5, which encodes a member of the large AP2/ERF transcription factor family protein, was observed in the stem region where crown root initiation occurs, A putative auxin response element in the CRL5 promoter region specifically interacted with a rice ARF, demonstrating that CRL5 may be a direct target of an ARF, similar to CRL1/ADVENTITIOUS ROOTLESS1 (ARL1) that also regulates crown root initiation, A crl1 crl5 double mutant displayed an additive phenotype, indicating that these two genes function in different genetic pathways for crown root initiation, In addition, ProACT:CRL5/WT showed a cytokinin-resistant phenotype for crown root initiation, and also up-regulated the expression of two negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, OsRR1 and OsRR2, which were downregulated in crl5, Transgenic plants that over-expressed OsRR1 under the control of the CRL5 promoter in a crl5 mutant background produced a higher number of crown roots than the crl5 plant, Taken together, these results indicate that auxin-induced CRL5 promotes crown root initiation through repression of cytokinin signaling by positively regulating type-A RR, OsRR1
