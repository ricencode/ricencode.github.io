## Connection
1. __OsOxi1__, __OsPti1a__, [AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation%5BTitle%5D)),  Both OsOxi1-overexpressing transgenic lines and the ospti1a mutant were highly sensitive to ROS treatment, indicating that OsOxi1 and OsPti1a are involved in ROS-mediated signaling in opposing ways, OsOxi1 phosphorylates Thr-233 of OsPti1a and a point mutation of Thr-233 enhanced disease susceptibility to a bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv, oryzae (Xoo), suggesting that the phosphorylation of OsPti1a by OsOxi1 is essential for basal resistance to Xoo, Taken together, our data suggest that OsOxi1 positively regulates defense responses through the phosphorylation of OsPti1a, causing the release from an OsPti1a-dependent inhibition of the responses,AGC kinase OsOxi1 positively regulates basal resistance through suppression of OsPti1a-mediated negative regulation
