## Expression information

## Key message
1. __brown planthopper__, [OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBi1, a rice gene, encodes a novel protein with a CBS-like domain and its expression is induced in responses to herbivore feeding%5BTitle%5D)),  Increase in the level of OsBi1 expression was detected in rice plants shortly after brown planthopper feeding, Evidences suggest that OsBi1 is a BPH-inducible gene that is implicated in the resistance of rice plants to brown planthopper
