1. __cell wall__, [Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsBBI1-overexpressing plants showed higher levels of H(2)O(2) accumulation in cells and higher levels of phenolic compounds and cross-linking of proteins in cell walls at infection sites by M, The cell walls were thicker in the OsBBI1-overexpressing plants and thinner in the mutant plants than in the WT plants, Our results suggest that OsBBI1 modulates broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus by modifying cell wall defence responses,Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence
2. __blast__, [Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsBBI1 was induced by rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, as well as chemical inducers, benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid, This indicates that OsBBI1 modulates broad-spectrum resistance against the blast fungus, Our results suggest that OsBBI1 modulates broad-spectrum resistance to blast fungus by modifying cell wall defence responses
3. __disease resistance__, [Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence%5BTitle%5D)),  We report that a rice gene, OsBBI1, encoding a RING finger protein with E3 ligase activity, mediates broad-spectrum disease resistance
4. __salicylic acid__, [Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression of OsBBI1 was induced by rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, as well as chemical inducers, benzothiadiazole and salicylic acid
5. __disease__, [Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice RING protein OsBBI1 with E3 ligase activity confers broad-spectrum resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae by modifying the cell wall defence%5BTitle%5D)),  We report that a rice gene, OsBBI1, encoding a RING finger protein with E3 ligase activity, mediates broad-spectrum disease resistance, The functional characterization of OsBBI1 provides insight into the E3 ligase-mediated innate immunity, and a practical tool for constructing broad-spectrum resistance against the most destructive disease in rice
