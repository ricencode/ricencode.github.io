## Key message
1. __cellulose__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components, Correlation analysis indicated that the expression of OsBC1L4 was highly correlated to that of several primary wall-forming cellulose synthase genes (CESAs), Moreover, the expression level of several cellulose-related genes is increased in Osbc1l4 mutants, which suggests that a feedback mechanism may exist during cellulose synthesis,OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice
2. __tiller__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
3. __cell wall__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  OsBC1L4 protein is mainly located in the cell wall and plasma membrane
4. __dwarf__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
5. __starch__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  A decrease in cellulose content but the increase in pectin and starch contents was identified in Osbc1l4 mutants by measuring the content of wall components
6. __culm__, [OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsBC1L4 encodes a COBRA-like protein that affects cellulose synthesis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Previously, a dwarf mutant with fewer tillers, Osbc1l4 (Oryza sativa brittle culm 1 like 4), was identified by screening a rice T-DNA insertion mutant library
