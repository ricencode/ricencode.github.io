## Key message
1. __blast__, [A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress%5BTitle%5D)),  Expression of OsBISCPL1 in leaves was significantly up-regulated after treatments with benzothiadiazole, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 1-amino cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, and also up-regulated in incompatible interactions between rice and the blast fungus, Magnaporthe grisea
2. __oxidative__, [A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress%5BTitle%5D)), " Furthermore, the OsBISCPL1-overexpressing plants also showed an increased tolerance to oxidative stress and up-regulated expression of oxidative stress-related genes, The results suggest that the OsBISCPL1 may be involved in regulation of defense responses against pathogen infection and oxidative stress,A rice serine carboxypeptidase-like gene OsBISCPL1 is involved in regulation of defense responses against biotic and oxidative stress"
