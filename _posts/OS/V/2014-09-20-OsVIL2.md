2. __heading date__, [LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(LC2 and OsVIL2 promote rice flowering by photoperoid-induced epigenetic silencing of OsLF%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results showed that expressions of LC2 and OsVIL2 are induced by SD (short-day) conditions and both lc2 mutant and OsVIL2-RNAi lines display delayed heading date, consistent with the reduced expression levels of Hd1 and Hd3a
