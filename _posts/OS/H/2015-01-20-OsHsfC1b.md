## Key message
1. __homeostasis__, [Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D)),  Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis
2. __salt stress__, [Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D)), " METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment, CONCLUSIONS: OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice"
3. __transcription factor__, [Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we characterized the function of the OsHsfC1b (Os01g53220) transcription factor from rice, Transient expression of OsHsfC1b fused to GFP in protoplasts revealed nuclear localization of the transcription factor,Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica
4. __ ABA __, [Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D)),  For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment
5. __growth__, [Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D)),  Furthermore, OsHsfC1b is involved in the response to osmotic stress and is required for plant growth under non-stress conditions
6. __salt__, [Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica%5BTitle%5D)), " METHODOLOGY: We analysed the expression of OsHsfC1b in the rice japonica cultivars Dongjin and Nipponbare exposed to salt stress as well as after mannitol, abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2) treatment, For functional characterization of OsHsfC1b, we analysed the physiological response of a T-DNA insertion line (hsfc1b) and two artificial micro-RNA (amiRNA) knock-down lines to salt, mannitol and ABA treatment, PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Expression of OsHsfC1b was induced by salt, mannitol and ABA, but not by H(2)O(2), Impaired function of OsHsfC1b in the hsfc1b mutant and the amiRNA lines led to decreased salt and osmotic stress tolerance, increased sensitivity to ABA, and temporal misregulation of salt-responsive genes involved in signalling and ion homeostasis, CONCLUSIONS: OsHsfC1b plays a role in ABA-mediated salt stress tolerance in rice,Transcription factor OsHsfC1b regulates salt tolerance and development in Oryza sativa ssp. japonica"
