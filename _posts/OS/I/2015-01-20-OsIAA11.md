1. __lateral root__, [A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development, The gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development, The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia, Taken together, the results indicate that the gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice,A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice
2. __iaa__, [A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, a member of the rice Aux/IAA family genes, OsIAA11 (LOC_Os03g43400), was isolated from a rice mutant defective in lateral root development, The gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 strictly blocks the initiation of lateral root primordia, but it does not affect crown root development, The expression of OsIAA11 is defined in root tips, lateral root caps, steles, and lateral root primordia, The auxin reporter DR5-GUS (beta-glucuronidase) was expressed at lower levels in the mutant than in wild-type, indicating that OsIAA11 is involved in auxin signaling in root caps, The transcript abundance of both OsPIN1b and OsPIN10a was diminished in root tips of the Osiaa11 mutant, Taken together, the results indicate that the gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 caused the inhibition of lateral root development in rice,A gain-of-function mutation in OsIAA11 affects lateral root development in rice
