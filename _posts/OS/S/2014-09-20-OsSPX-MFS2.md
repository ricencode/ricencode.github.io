## Key message
1. __ pi __, [Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Complex regulation of two target genes encoding SPX-MFS proteins by rice miR827 in response to phosphate starvation%5BTitle%5D)),  In parallel, we analyzed the responses of the two OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 gene targets to Pi starvation, In contrast, OsSPX-MFS2 responds in a diametrically opposed manner to Pi starvation, The accumulation of OsSPX-MFS2 mRNA is dramatically enhanced under Pi starvation, suggesting the involvement of complex regulation of osa-miR827 and its two target genes, This suggests that OsSPX-MFS1 and OsSPX-MFS2 are both negatively regulated by osa-miR827 abundance although they respond differently to external Pi conditions
