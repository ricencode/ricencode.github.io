## Key message
1. __seed germination__, [A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A rice lectin receptor-like kinase that is involved in innate immune responses also contributes to seed germination%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that the rice lectin receptor-like kinase OslecRK contributes to both seed germination and plant innate immunity, We demonstrate that knocking down the OslecRK gene depresses the expression of α–amylase genes, reducing seed viability and thereby decreasing the rate of seed germination
