3. __grain__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identified a rice Cd transporter, OsLCT1, involved in Cd transport to the grains, The knockdown plants of OsLCT1 accumulated approximately half as much Cd in the grains as did the control plants, The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression, These results suggest that OsLCT1 functions at the nodes in Cd transport into grains and that in a standard japonica cultivar, the regulation of OsLCT1 enables the generation of low-Cd rice without negative effects on agronomical traits,Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains
4. __reproductive__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage
5. __growth__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D)),  The content of other metals in rice grains and plant growth were not negatively affected by OsLCT1 suppression
6. __xylem__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D)),  RNAi-mediated knockdown of OsLCT1 did not affect xylem-mediated Cd transport but reduced phloem-mediated Cd transport
7. __leaf__, [Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Low-affinity cation transporter (OsLCT1) regulates cadmium transport into rice grains%5BTitle%5D)),  In rice plants, strong OsLCT1 expression was observed in leaf blades and nodes during the reproductive stage
