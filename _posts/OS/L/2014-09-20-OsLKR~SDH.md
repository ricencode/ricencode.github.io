## Expression information

## Key message
1. __endosperm__, [Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain%5BTitle%5D)),  OsLKR/SDH was highly expressed in the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm
2. __transcription factor__, [Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF, This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively
3. __seed__, [Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain%5BTitle%5D)),  L), a bifunctional OsLKR/SDH is predominantly present in seeds, Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF
4. __grain__, [Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain%5BTitle%5D)),  Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain

## Connection
1. __OsLKR~SDH__, __RPBF~OsDof3__, [Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Differences in transcriptional regulatory mechanisms functioning for free lysine content and seed storage protein accumulation in rice grain%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we show that OsLKR/SDH is directly regulated by major transcriptional regulators of seed storage protein (SSP) genes: the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF), RISBZ1, and the DNA-binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factor, RPBF, Mutation analyses in planta, trans-activation reporter assays in vivo and electrophorestic mobility shift assays in vitro showed that the RPBF-recognizing prolamin box (AAAG) and the RISBZ1-recognizing GCN4 motif (TGAG/CTCA) act as important cis-elements for proper expression of OsLKR/SDH like SSP genes, Reducing either RISBZ1 or RPBF decreased OsLKR/SDH levels, resulting in an increase in free lysine content in rice grain, This result was in contrast to the fact that a significant reduction of SSP was observed only when these transcription factors were simultaneously reduced, suggesting that RISBZ1 and RPBF regulate SSP genes and OsLKR/SDH with high and limited redundancy, respectively
