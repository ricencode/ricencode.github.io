## Key message
1. __photosynthesis__, [Identification of Fe-excess-induced genes in rice shoots reveals a WRKY transcription factor responsive to Fe, drought and senescence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Identification of Fe-excess-induced genes in rice shoots reveals a WRKY transcription factor responsive to Fe, drought and senescence%5BTitle%5D)),  We isolated 24 sequences which have putative functions in distinct cellular processes, such as transcription regulation (OsWRKY80), stress response (OsGAP1, DEAD-BOX RNA helicase), proteolysis (oryzain-alpha, rhomboid protein), photosynthesis (chlorophyll a/b binding protein), sugar metabolism (beta glucosidase) and electron transport (NADH ubiquinone oxireductase)

3. __defense response__, [Constitutive expression of a rice GTPase-activating protein induces defense responses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Constitutive expression of a rice GTPase-activating protein induces defense responses%5BTitle%5D)), "G-proteins (guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that usually exhibit GTPase activities) and related signal transduction processes play important roles in mediating plant defense responses; here, a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA clone, OsGAP1, encoding a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that also contains a protein kinase C conserved region 2 (C2) domain is reported"

2. __OsGAP1__, __OsYchF1__, [An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(An ancient P-loop GTPase in rice is regulated by a higher plant-specific regulatory protein%5BTitle%5D)),  Using the OsYchF1-OsGAP1 pair from rice as the prototype, we provide evidence for the regulation of GTPase/ATPase activities and RNA binding capacity of a plant YchF (OsYchF1) by its regulatory protein (OsGAP1), The effects of OsGAP1 on the subcellular localization/cycling and physiological functions of OsYchF1 are also discussed, The finding that OsYchF1 and OsGAP1 are involved in plant defense response might shed light on the functional roles of YchF homologues in plants
3. __OsGAP1__, __OsRab11__, [OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking%5BTitle%5D)),  OsGAP1 strongly stimulated OsRab8a and OsRab11, which are homologs of the mammalian Rab8 and Rab11 proteins that are essential for Golgi to plasma membrane (PM) and trans-Golgi network (TGN) to PM trafficking, respectively, sativa dissociation inhibitor 3 (OsGDI3)-catalyzed OsRab11 recycling at an early stage, but the OsGAP1(R385A) and (R450A) mutants do not, Surprisingly, OsRab11 overproduction relieved the inhibitory effect of the OsGAP1 mutants on vesicular trafficking, Thus, the OsGAP1 mutants may inhibit TGN to PM or central vacuole trafficking because they induce the sequestration of endogenous Rab11, We propose that OsGAP1 facilitates vesicular trafficking from the TGN to the PM or central vacuole by both stimulating the GTPase activity of OsRab11 and increasing the recycling of inactive OsRab11,OsGAP1 functions as a positive regulator of OsRab11-mediated TGN to PM or vacuole trafficking
