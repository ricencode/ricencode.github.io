## Key message
1. __meristem__, [The rice heterochronic gene SUPERNUMERARY BRACT regulates the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice heterochronic gene SUPERNUMERARY BRACT regulates the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we report the identification of the SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB) gene controlling the transition from spikelet meristem to floral meristem and the floral organ development, SNB is expressed in all the examined tissues, but most strongly in the newly emerging spikelet meristems, In SNB knockout plants, the transition from spikelet meristems to floral meristems is delayed, resulting in the production of multiple rudimentary glumes in an alternative phyllotaxy, These phenotypes suggest that snb is a heterochronic mutant, affecting the phase transition of spikelet meristems, the pattern formation of floral organs and spikelet meristem determinancy
