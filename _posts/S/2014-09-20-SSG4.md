## Key message
1. __starch__, [Amyloplast-localized SUBSTANDARD STARCH GRAIN4 protein influences the size of starch grains in rice endosperm](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Amyloplast-localized SUBSTANDARD STARCH GRAIN4 protein influences the size of starch grains in rice endosperm%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we report a novel rice (Oryza sativa) mutant called substandard starch grain4 (ssg4) that develops enlarged SGs in the endosperm, Enlargement of SGs in ssg4 was also observed in other starch-accumulating tissues such as pollen grains, root caps, and young pericarps, SSG4 will be a useful molecular tool for future starch breeding and biotechnology
