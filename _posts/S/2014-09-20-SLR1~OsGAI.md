9. __ ga __, [Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Analysis of the rice mutant dwarf and gladius leaf 1. Aberrant katanin-mediated microtubule organization causes up-regulation of gibberellin biosynthetic genes independently of gibberellin signaling%5BTitle%5D)),  The enhanced expression of GA biosynthetic genes in dgl1 is not caused by inappropriate GA signaling because the expression of these genes was repressed by GA3 treatment, and degradation of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 was triggered by GA3 in this mutant
10. __homeostasis__, [Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Gibberellin homeostasis and plant height control by EUI and a role for gibberellin in root gravity responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Disturbing GA homeostasis affected the expression of the GA signaling genes GID1 (GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF 1), GID2 and SLR1

16. __ ga __, [Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice early flowering1, a CKI, phosphorylates DELLA protein SLR1 to negatively regulate gibberellin signalling%5BTitle%5D)),  Overexpression of SLR1 in wild-type plants caused a severe dwarf phenotype, which was significantly suppressed by EL1 deficiency, indicating the negative effect of SLR1 on GA signalling requires the EL1 function, Further studies showed that the phosphorylation of SLR1 is important for maintaining its activity and stability, and mutation of the candidate phosphorylation site of SLR1 results in the altered GA signalling
17. __shoot__, [Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant%5BTitle%5D)),  GA perception by GID1 causes SLR1 protein degradation involving the F-box protein GID2; this triggers GA-associated responses such as shoot elongation and seed germination

27. __submergence__, [Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " In the Sub1A overexpression line, SLR1 protein levels declined under prolonged submergence but were accompanied by an increase in accumulation of SLRL1, which lacks the DELLA domain, Together, these results demonstrate that Sub1A limits ethylene-promoted GA responsiveness during submergence by augmenting accumulation of the GA signaling repressors SLR1 and SLRL1,Submergence tolerance conferred by Sub1A is mediated by SLR1 and SLRL1 restriction of gibberellin responses in rice"
28. __ ga __, [slender Rice, a Constitutive Gibberellin Response Mutant, Is Caused by a Null Mutation of the SLR1 Gene, an Ortholog of the Height-Regulating Gene GAI/RGA/RHT/D8](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(slender Rice, a Constitutive Gibberellin Response Mutant, Is Caused by a Null Mutation of the SLR1 Gene, an Ortholog of the Height-Regulating Gene GAI/RGA/RHT/D8%5BTitle%5D)),  These results indicate that the product of the SLR1 gene is an intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway, Furthermore, introduction of a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type SLR1 gene into the slr1-1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to normal, Thus, we demonstrate opposite GA response phenotypes depending on the type of mutations in SLR1
29. __shoot__, [The Gibberellin Signaling Pathway Is Regulated by the Appearance and Disappearance of SLENDER RICE1 in Nuclei](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Gibberellin Signaling Pathway Is Regulated by the Appearance and Disappearance of SLENDER RICE1 in Nuclei%5BTitle%5D)),  Application of GA(3) to SLR1-GFP overproducers induced GA actions such as shoot elongation, downregulation of GA 20-oxidase expression, and upregulation of SLR1 expression linked with the disappearance of the nuclear SLR1-GFP protein
30. __gibberellin__, [Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant%5BTitle%5D)), The rice (Oryza sativa) DELLA protein SLR1 acts as a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling,Release of the repressive activity of rice DELLA protein SLR1 by gibberellin does not require SLR1 degradation in the gid2 mutant

32. __growth__, [The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity%5BTitle%5D)),  When SLR1 proteins with various deletions were over-expressed in rice, the severity of dwarfism correlated with the transactivation activity observed in yeast, indicating that SLR1 suppresses plant growth through transactivation activity, The C-terminal GRAS domain of SLR1 also exhibits a suppressive function on plant growth, possibly by directly or indirectly interacting with the promoter region of target genes
33. __ ga __, [Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Overexpression of a GRAS protein lacking the DELLA domain confers altered gibberellin responses in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Based on the constitutive GA response phenotype of slr1 mutants, SLR1 has been thought to be the sole DELLA-type protein suppressing GA signals in rice, However, the repressive activity of SLRL1 against GA signaling was much weaker than a truncated SLR1 lacking the DELLA domain
34. __ ga __, [The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The suppressive function of the rice DELLA protein SLR1 is dependent on its transcriptional activation activity%5BTitle%5D)),  This activity was suppressed by the GA-dependent GID1-SLR1 interaction, which may explain why GA responses are induced in the presence of GA, Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of SLR1 has two roles in GA signaling: interaction with GID1 and transactivation activity
35. __gibberellin__, [The Gibberellin Signaling Pathway Is Regulated by the Appearance and Disappearance of SLENDER RICE1 in Nuclei](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Gibberellin Signaling Pathway Is Regulated by the Appearance and Disappearance of SLENDER RICE1 in Nuclei%5BTitle%5D)), The slender rice1 mutant (slr1) shows a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype

37. __gibberellin__, [Characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying gibberellin perception complex formation in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Characterization of the molecular mechanism underlying gibberellin perception complex formation in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The DELLA protein SLENDER RICE1 (SLR1) is a repressor of gibberellin (GA) signaling in rice (Oryza sativa), and most of the GA-associated responses are induced upon SLR1 degradation, It is assumed that interaction between GIBBERELLIN INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) and the N-terminal DELLA/TVHYNP motif of SLR1 triggers F-box protein GID2-mediated SLR1 degradation
