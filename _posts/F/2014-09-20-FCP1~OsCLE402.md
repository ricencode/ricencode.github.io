## Key message
1. __shoot apical meristem__, [WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX4 is involved in meristem maintenance and is negatively regulated by the CLE gene FCP1 in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Consistent with similarities in the shoot apical meristem phenotypes caused by overexpression of FCP1 and downregulation of WOX4, expression of WOX4 was negatively regulated by FCP1 (FCP2)
2. __root development__, [Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Functional diversification of CLAVATA3-related CLE proteins in meristem maintenance in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Constitutive expression of FCP1 results in consumption of the SAM in the vegetative phase, and application of an FCP1 CLE peptide in vitro disturbs root development by misspecification of cell fates in the RAM
