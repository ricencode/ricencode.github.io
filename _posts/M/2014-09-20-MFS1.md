## Key message
1. __sterile__, [MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the sterile lemma was homeotically converted to the rudimentary glume and the body of the palea was degenerated in mfs1, Furthermore, our findings suggest that MFS1 positively regulates the expression of LONG STERILE LEMMA and the INDETERMINATE SPIKELET1 (IDS1)-like genes SUPERNUMERARY BRACT and OsIDS1
2. __meristem__, [MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, we identified a rice (Oryza sativa) spikelet mutant, multi-floret spikelet1 (mfs1), that showed delayed transformation of spikelet meristems to floral meristems, which resulted in an extra hull-like organ and an elongated rachilla, These results suggest that the MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1 (MFS1) gene plays an important role in the regulation of spikelet meristem determinacy and floral organ identity, MFS1 messenger RNA is expressed in various tissues, especially in the spikelet and floral meristems
3. __palea__, [MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(MULTI-FLORET SPIKELET1, which encodes an AP2/ERF protein, determines spikelet meristem fate and sterile lemma identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, the sterile lemma was homeotically converted to the rudimentary glume and the body of the palea was degenerated in mfs1
