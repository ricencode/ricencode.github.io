8. __floral__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions, These results indicate that Hd3a and RFT1 act as floral activators under SD conditions, and that RFT1 expression is partly regulated by chromatin modification
9. __heading date__, [Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Footprints of natural and artificial selection for photoperiod pathway genes in Oryza%5BTitle%5D)),  We examined the footprints of natural and artificial selections for four major genes of the photoperiod pathway, namely PHYTOCHROME B (PhyB), HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1), HEADING DATE 3a (Hd3a), and EARLY HEADING DATE 1 (Ehd1), by investigation of the patterns of nucleotide polymorphisms in cultivated and wild rice

79. __Hd3a__, __RFT1__, [Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response%5BTitle%5D)),  In a near-isogenic line with the weak-photoperiod-sensitivity allele of Hd16, transcription levels of Ehd1, Hd3a, and RFT1 increased under long-day conditions, and transcription levels of Hd3a and RFT1 decreased under short-day conditions
80. __Ghd7.1~Hd2~OsPRR37~DTH7__, __Hd3a__, [Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Days to heading 7, a major quantitative locus determining photoperiod sensitivity and regional adaptation in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  We show that in long days DTH7 acts downstream of the photoreceptor phytochrome B to repress the expression of Ehd1, an up-regulator of the &quot;florigen&quot; genes (Hd3a and RFT1), leading to delayed flowering
81. __Hd3a__, __Hd5~DTH8~Ghd8~OsHAP3H~LHD1~EF8__, [EF8 is involved in photoperiodic flowering pathway and chlorophyll biogenesis in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(EF8 is involved in photoperiodic flowering pathway and chlorophyll biogenesis in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  Our data showed that EF8 delayed flowering time under long-day conditions by altering the rhythmic expression patterns of 'florigen' genes Hd3a and RFT1
82. __Hd3a__, __OsCCT01__, [Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Three CCT domain-containing genes were identified to regulate heading date by candidate gene-based association mapping and transformation in rice.%5BTitle%5D)),  The overexpression of OsCCT01 delayed flowering through suppressing the expression of Ehd1, Hd3a and RFT1 under both long day and short day conditions
