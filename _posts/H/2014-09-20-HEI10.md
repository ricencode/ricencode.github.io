## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D)),  Mice HEI10(mei4) mutant displays no obvious defect other than meiotic failure from an absence of chiasmata, In this study, we characterize rice HEI10 by map-based cloning and explore its function during meiotic recombination, HEI10 protein displays a highly dynamic localization on the meiotic chromosomes, Together our results suggest that HEI10 is the homolog of budding yeast Zip3 and Caenorhabditis elegans ZHP-3, and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various meiotic components,The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers
2. __meiotic__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10
3. __cell cycle__, [The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of rice HEI10 in the formation of meiotic crossovers%5BTitle%5D)), HEI10 was first described in human as a RING domain-containing protein that regulates cell cycle and cell invasion

## Connection
1. __HEI10__, __OsMSH5__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10, Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5, Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
