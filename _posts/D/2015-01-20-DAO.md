## Key message
1. __seed__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
2. __pollen__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
3. __auxin__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice, Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants, Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development
4. __anther__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice, Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers and ovaries
5. __reproductive__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development
6. __homeostasis__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Collectively, these data support a key role of DAO in auxin catabolism and maintenance of auxin homeostasis central to plant reproductive development
7. __iaa__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Rice mutant lines lacking a functional DAO display increased levels of free IAA in anthers and ovaries, Furthermore, exogenous application of IAA or overexpression of the auxin biosynthesis gene OsYUCCA1 phenocopies the dao mutants, We show that recombinant DAO converts the active IAA into biologically inactive 2-oxoindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) in vitro
8. __fertility__, [A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A role for a dioxygenase in auxin metabolism and reproductive development in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we demonstrate that the dioxygenase for auxin oxidation (DAO) gene, encoding a putative 2-oxoglutarate-dependent-Fe (II) dioxygenase, is essential for anther dehiscence, pollen fertility, and seed initiation in rice
