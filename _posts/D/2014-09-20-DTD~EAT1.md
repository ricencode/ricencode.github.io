## Connection
1. __DTD~EAT1__, __TIP2~bHLH142__, [The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The Rice Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factor TDR INTERACTING PROTEIN2 Is a Central Switch in Early Anther Development.%5BTitle%5D)), We revealed that TIP2 acts upstream of TDR and EAT1 and directly regulates the expression of TDR and EAT1.
