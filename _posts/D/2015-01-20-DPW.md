## Key message
1. __sterile__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine, Moreover, we demonstrate that the monocot DPW from rice complements the dicot Arabidopsis thaliana male sterile2 (ms2) mutant and is the probable ortholog of MS2
2. __microspore__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
3. __anther__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine, Chemical analysis revealed that dpw anthers had a dramatic reduction in cutin monomers and an altered composition of cuticular wax, as well as soluble fatty acids and alcohols, Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development, These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots
4. __tapetal__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
5. __pollen__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine, These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots
6. __anther development__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine, Using map-based cloning, we identified the DPW gene, which is expressed in both tapetal cells and microspores during anther development
7. __grain__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice (Oryza sativa) male-sterile mutant, defective pollen wall (dpw), which displays defective anther development and degenerated pollen grains with an irregular exine
8. __cuticle__, [Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Defective pollen wall is required for anther and microspore development in rice and encodes a fatty acyl carrier protein reductase%5BTitle%5D)),  These data suggest that DPWs participate in a conserved step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for anther cuticle and pollen sporopollenin biosynthesis in monocots and dicots
