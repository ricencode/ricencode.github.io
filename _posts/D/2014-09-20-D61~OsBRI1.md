2. __grain size__, [Morphological alteration caused by brassinosteroid insensitivity increases the biomass and grain production of rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Morphological alteration caused by brassinosteroid insensitivity increases the biomass and grain production of rice%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the small grain size of d61-7 counters any increase in grain yield, leading to the same grain yield as that of wild type even at high density

11. __D61~OsBRI1__, __OsBISERK1~OsSERK1~OsBAK1__, [OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSERK1 regulates rice development but not immunity to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae or Magnaporthe oryzae%5BTitle%5D)), In yeast, OsSERK1 interacts with itself forming homodimers, and also interacts with the kinase domains of OsSERK2 and BRI1, respectively.
