1. __resistant__, [R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(R gene expression induced by a type-III effector triggers disease resistance in rice%5BTitle%5D)), " Resistant and susceptible alleles of Xa27 encode identical proteins, However, expression of only the resistant allele occurs when a rice plant is challenged by bacteria harbouring avrXa27, whose product is a nuclear localized type-III effector"
2. __cell wall__, [XA27 depends on an amino-terminal signal-anchor-like sequence to localize to the apoplast for resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(XA27 depends on an amino-terminal signal-anchor-like sequence to localize to the apoplast for resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae%5BTitle%5D)),  The localization of XA27-green fluorescent protein to the apoplast was verified by detection of the protein on cell walls of leaf sheath and root cells after plasmolysis, Similarly, XA27-FLAG localizes to xylem vessels and cell walls of xylem parenchyma cells, revealed by immunogold electron microscopy
