2. __flower__, [Knockdown of SAMS genes encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetases causes methylation alterations of DNAs and histones and leads to late flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Knockdown of SAMS genes encoding S-adenosyl-l-methionine synthetases causes methylation alterations of DNAs and histones and leads to late flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Knockdown of OsSAMS1, 2 and 3 led to distinguished late flowering and greatly reduced the expression of the flowering key genes, Early heading date 1 (Ehd1), Hd3a and RFT1 (rice FT-like genes)
3. __flower__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions, Although RFT1 RNAi plants flowered normally, double RFT1-Hd3a RNAi plants did not flower up to 300 days after sowing (DAS), indicating that Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice, RFT1 expression was very low in wild-type plants, but there was a marked increase in RFT1 expression by 70 DAS in Hd3a RNAi plants, which flowered 90 DAS,Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice

18. __floral__, [Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd3a and RFT1 are essential for flowering in rice%5BTitle%5D)), RICE FLOWERING LOCUS T 1 (RFT1/FT-L3) is the closest homologue of Heading date 3a (Hd3a), which is thought to encode a mobile flowering signal and promote floral transition under short-day (SD) conditions, These results indicate that Hd3a and RFT1 act as floral activators under SD conditions, and that RFT1 expression is partly regulated by chromatin modification
