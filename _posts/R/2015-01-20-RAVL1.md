## Key message
1. __BR signaling__, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis
2. __homeostasis__, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis, This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways
3. __ BR __, [RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(RAV-Like1 maintains brassinosteroid homeostasis via the coordinated activation of BRI1 and biosynthetic genes in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This report shows that RAVL1 regulates the expression of the BR receptor, Furthermore, RAVL1 is also required for the expression of the BR biosynthetic genes D2, D11, and BRD1 that are subject to BR negative feedback, Also, RAVL1 is necessary for the response of these genes to changes in cellular BR homeostasis, Genetic evidence is presented to strengthen the observation that the primary action of RAVL1 mediates the expression of genes involved in BR signaling and biosynthesis, This study thus describes a regulatory circuit modulating the homeostasis of BR in which RAVL1 ensures the basal activity of both the signaling and the biosynthetic pathways
