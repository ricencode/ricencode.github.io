## Connection
1. __ZEP1__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1, Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1
2. __MER3~RCK__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZIP4 in homologous chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, we identify the rice ZIP4 homolog, a member of the ZMM gene group, and explore its relationship with two other characterized ZMM genes, MER3 and ZEP1, Immunocytological analyses of wild-type rice reveal that ZIP4 presents as punctuate foci and colocalizes with MER3 in prophase I meiocytes, Additionally, ZIP4 is essential for the loading of MER3 onto chromosomes, but not vice versa, Double-mutant analyses show that zip4 mer3 displays a greater decrease in the mean number of chiasmata than either of the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, suggesting that ZIP4 and MER3 work cooperatively to promote CO formation but their individual contributions are not completely identical in rice, Although zep1 alone gives an increased chiasma number, both zip4 zep1 and mer3 zep1 show a much lower chiasma number than the zip4 or mer3 single mutants, These results imply that the normal functions of ZIP4 and MER3 are required for the regulation of COs by ZEP1
3. __HEI10__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10, Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5, Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
4. __OsMSH5__, __ZIP4~SPO22__, [The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsMSH5 in crossover formation during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  OsMSH5 can be loaded onto meiotic chromosomes in Oszip4, Osmer3, and hei10, Furthermore, the residual chiasmata were shown to be the least frequent among the zmm mutants, including Osmer3, Oszip4, hei10, and Osmsh5, Taken together, we propose that OsMSH5 functions upstream of OsZIP4, OsMER3, and HEI10 in class I crossover formation
