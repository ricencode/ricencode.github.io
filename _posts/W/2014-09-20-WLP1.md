## Key message
1. __photosynthesis__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  The transcription pattern of a number of genes involved in plastidial transcription/translation and in photosynthesis was altered in the wlp1 mutants
2. __chloroplast__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  The WLP1 protein localized to the chloroplast, These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions,The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions
3. __panicle__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
4. __leaf__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we describe a rice mutant named wlp1 (white leaf and panicles 1) selected from a population of tissue culture regenerants
5. __seedling__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)),  WLP1 was mainly transcribed in green tissues and particularly abundantly in the early seedling leaves
6. __temperature__, [The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions%5BTitle%5D)), " In addition, the expression level of WLP1 was induced by the low temperature, These results reveal that WLP1 is required for normal chloroplast development, especially under low temperature conditions,The rice nuclear gene WLP1 encoding a chloroplast ribosome L13 protein is needed for chloroplast development in rice grown under low temperature conditions"
