1. __tillering__, [THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1),THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
2. __growth__, [THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation
3. __tiller__, [THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1), Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation,THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice

5. __dwarf__, [THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Similarly to the high tiller number and dwarf mutants in rice, the increased tiller number of this1 plants is ascribed to the release of tiller bud outgrowth rather than to increased tiller bud formation

9. __fertility__, [THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control,THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
10. __spikelet__, [THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  This study characterized a rice mutant, the most obvious phenotypes of which are high tillering, reduced height, and infertile spikelets (named this1), Homology searches revealed that THIS1 is conserved in both monocots and eudicots, suggesting that it plays fundamental role in regulating branch and spikelet fertility, as well as other aspects of developmental control,THIS1 is a putative lipase that regulates tillering, plant height, and spikelet fertility in rice
