3. __abiotic stress__, [Stress repressive expression of rice SRZ1 and characterization of plant SRZ gene family](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Stress repressive expression of rice SRZ1 and characterization of plant SRZ gene family%5BTitle%5D)), " Ectopic expression of SRZ1 in tobacco plants repressed expression of abiotic stress-related genes including osmotin, NtERB10B, NtERB10C, and increased plant sensitivity to cold and salt stresses, This study indicates that SRZ1 and its relatives in plants may play negative roles in abiotic stress signaling and the down-regulation of them might be crucial for plant tolerance against stresses"
