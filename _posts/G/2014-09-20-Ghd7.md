## Expression information
__Expression__:We carried out RNA in situ hybridization and Ghd7 promoter-driven GFP transformation to examine sites of Ghd7 expression. The RNA in situ hybridization signals indicated that the gene is expressed in young tissues, such as the apical meristem, developing leaves and the leaf sheaths of the young seedling, the meristem of the root, the epidermal layer of developing stems and the branch-primordia of developing panicles  
__OverExpression__:Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long-day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size.   
__RNAi__:Natural mutants with reduced function enable rice to be cultivated in temperate and cooler regions.  

## Key message
1. __height__, [Natural variation in Ghd7 is an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in Ghd7 is an important regulator of heading date and yield potential in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Here we show that the quantitative trait locus (QTL) Ghd7, isolated from an elite rice hybrid and encoding a CCT domain protein, has major effects on an array of traits in rice, including number of grains per panicle, plant height and heading date, Enhanced expression of Ghd7 under long-day conditions delays heading and increases plant height and panicle size
2. __heading date__, [OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsELF3-1, an ortholog of Arabidopsis early flowering 3, regulates rice circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Moreover, OsELF3-1 suppresses a flowering repressor grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7) to indirectly accelerate flowering under long-day (LD) conditions
3. __flower__, [DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(DTH8 suppresses flowering in rice, influencing plant height and yield potential simultaneously%5BTitle%5D)),  Ehd1 and Hd3a can also be down-regulated by the photoperiodic flowering genes Ghd7 and Hd1 (a rice ortholog of CONSTANS)
4. __flower__, [Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Hd16, a gene for casein kinase I, is involved in the control of rice flowering time by modulating the day-length response%5BTitle%5D)),  By using near-isogenic lines with functional or deficient alleles of several rice flowering-time genes, we observed significant digenetic interactions between Hd16 and four other flowering-time genes (Ghd7, Hd1, DTH8 and Hd2), These results demonstrate that Hd16 acts as an inhibitor in the rice flowering pathway by enhancing the photoperiod response as a result of the phosphorylation of Ghd7
5. __grain__, [Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Natural variation in Hd17, a homolog of Arabidopsis ELF3 that is involved in rice photoperiodic flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Our results demonstrate that natural variation in Hd17 may change the transcription level of a flowering repressor, Grain number, plant height and heading date 7 (Ghd7), suggesting that Hd17 is part of rice's photoperiodic flowering pathway
6. __flower__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  On the other hand, under long-day (LD) conditions, flowering is delayed by the repressive function of Hd1 on FT-like genes and by downregulation of Ehd1 by the flowering repressor Ghd7 - a unique pathway in rice, Furthermore, Ehd3 ghd7 plants flowered earlier and show higher Ehd1 transcript levels than ehd3 ghd7 plants, suggesting a Ghd7-independent role of Ehd3 in the upregulation of Ehd1
7. __flower__, [A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene network for long-day flowering activates RFT1 encoding a mobile flowering signal in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  We propose that both positive (OsMADS50 and Ehd1) and negative (Hd1, phyB and Ghd7) regulators of RFT1 form a gene network that regulates LD flowering in rice
8. __height__, [A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A pair of floral regulators sets critical day length for Hd3a florigen expression in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Ghd7 (Grain number, plant height and heading date 7) was acutely induced when phytochrome signals coincided with a photosensitive phase set differently by distinct photoperiods and this induction repressed Ehd1 the next morning
9. __height__, [Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Trithorax group protein Oryza sativa Trithorax1 controls flowering time in rice via interaction with early heading date3%5BTitle%5D)),  However, the Grain number, plant height, and heading date7 (Ghd7) pathway was altered in ostrx1
10. __floral__, [Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Ehd3, encoding a plant homeodomain finger-containing protein, is a critical promoter of rice flowering%5BTitle%5D)),  Increased transcription of Ghd7 under LD conditions and reduced transcription of downstream Ehd1 and FT-like genes in the ehd3 mutants suggested that Ehd3 normally functions as an LD downregulator of Ghd7 in floral induction
