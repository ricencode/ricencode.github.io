## Key message
1. __salicylic acid__, [Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DREB1B promoter shows distinct stress-specific responses, and the overexpression of cDNA in tobacco confers improved abiotic and biotic stress tolerance%5BTitle%5D)),  The OsDREB1B gene was differentially regulated at the transcriptional level by osmotic stress, oxidative stress, salicylic acid, ABA, and cold, Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in T(2) transgenic Arabidopsis plants indicated that OsDREB1B shows stress-specific induction pattern in response to a variety of stresses like mannitol, NaCl, PEG, methyl viologen, cold, ABA, and salicylic acid
2. __transcription factor__, [Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B%5BTitle%5D)), Seven zinc-finger transcription factors are novel regulators of the stress responsive gene OsDREB1B
