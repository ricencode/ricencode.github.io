## Key message
1. __transporter__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing TOM1 or HvTOM1 released (14)C-labeled deoxymugineic acid but not (14)C-labeled nicotianamine, a structural analog and biosynthetic precursor of deoxymugineic acid, indicating that the TOM1 and HvTOM1 proteins are the phytosiderophore efflux transporters, In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid
2. __iron__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency
3. __root__, [Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Phytosiderophore efflux transporters are crucial for iron acquisition in graminaceous plants%5BTitle%5D)),  Under conditions of iron deficiency, rice and barley roots express high levels of TOM1 and HvTOM1, respectively, and the overexpression of these genes increased tolerance to iron deficiency, In rice roots, the efficiency of deoxymugineic acid secretion was enhanced by overexpression of TOM1 and decreased by its repression, providing further evidence that TOM1 encodes the efflux transporter of deoxymugineic acid
4. __root__, [ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE family in plants: lineage-specific expansion in monocotyledons and conserved genomic and expression features among rice (Oryza sativa) paralogs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ZINC-INDUCED FACILITATOR-LIKE family in plants: lineage-specific expansion in monocotyledons and conserved genomic and expression features among rice (Oryza sativa) paralogs%5BTitle%5D)),  Transcripts of OsZIFL4, OsZIFL5, OsZIFL7, and OsZIFL12 accumulate in response to Zn-excess and Fe-deficiency in roots, two stresses with partially overlapping responses
