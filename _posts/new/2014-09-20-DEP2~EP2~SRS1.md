9. __panicle__, [Rice DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 is essential for determining panicle outgrowth and elongation](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice DENSE AND ERECT PANICLE 2 is essential for determining panicle outgrowth and elongation%5BTitle%5D)),  Here, dense and erect panicle 2 (dep2) mutant, which shows a dense and erect panicle phenotype, was identified, Expression profiling of DEP2 revealed that it is highly expressed in young tissues, with most abundance in young panicles, Morphological and expression analysis indicated that mutation in DEP2 mainly affects the rapid elongation of rachis and primary and secondary branches, but does not impair the initiation or formation of panicle primordia, Further analysis suggests that decrease of panicle length in dep2 is caused by a defect in cell proliferation during the exponential elongation of panicle, Therefore, the study of DEP2 not only strengthens our understanding of the molecular genetic basis of panicle architecture but also has important implications for rice breeding
10. __vascular bundle__, [Erect panicle2 encodes a novel protein that regulates panicle erectness in indica rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Erect panicle2 encodes a novel protein that regulates panicle erectness in indica rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Anatomical investigations revealed that the ep2 mutants have more vascular bundles and a thicker stem than that of wild-type plants, explaining the panicle erectness phenotype in ep2 mutants, It was shown that EP2 was specifically expressed in the vascular bundles of internodes by GUS staining and RT-PCR
