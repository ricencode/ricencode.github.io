## Key message
1. __meiotic__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In the absence of OsAM1, many other critical meiotic components, including PAIR2, ZEP1 and OsMER3, could not be correctly installed onto chromosomes
2. __drought__, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)), " The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated"
3. __microspore__, [The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, ZEP1 is reloaded onto chromosomes in early microspores as the chromosome decondense, suggesting that ZEP1 might have other biological functions during this process
4. __meiosis__, [The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice%5BTitle%5D)), The central element protein ZEP1 of the synaptonemal complex regulates the number of crossovers during meiosis in rice
5. __meiotic__, [OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsSGO1 maintains synaptonemal complex stabilization in addition to protecting centromeric cohesion during rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Finally, we found that the centromeric localization of OsSGO1 depends on OsAM1, not other meiotic proteins such as OsREC8, PAIR2, OsMER3, or ZEP1
6. __meiotic__, [The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The role of OsCOM1 in homologous chromosome synapsis and recombination in rice meiosis%5BTitle%5D)),  Several key meiotic proteins, including ZEP1 and OsMER3, were not loaded normally onto chromosomes in Oscom1 mutants, whereas the localization of OsREC8, PAIR2 and PAIR3 seemed to be normal, Moreover, OsCOM1 was loaded normally onto meiotic chromosomes in Osrec8, zep1 and Osmer3 mutants, but could not be properly loaded in Osam1, pair2 and OsSPO11-1(RNAi) plants
7. __ ABA __, [The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(The rice OsDIL gene plays a role in drought tolerance at vegetative and reproductive stages%5BTitle%5D)),  The expression levels of the drought-responsive genes RD22, SODA1, bZIP46 and POD, as well as the ABA synthetic gene ZEP1 were up-regulated in the OsDIL-overexpression lines but the ABA degradation gene ABAOX3 was down-regulated
8. __meiosis__, [OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(OsAM1 is required for leptotene-zygotene transition in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  In contrast, in pair2, Osmer3 and zep1 mutants, OsAM1 could be loaded normally, suggesting that OsAM1 plays a fundamental role in building the proper chromosome structure at the beginning of meiosis
