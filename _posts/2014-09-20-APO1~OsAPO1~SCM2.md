## Key message
1. __vegetative__, [ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 temporally regulates meristem identity in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1 temporally regulates meristem identity in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  Vegetative development is also affected in the apo1, Leaves were formed rapidly throughout the vegetative phase, indicating that APO1 is also involved in temporal regulation of leaf production, These phenotypes suggest that the APO1 plays an important role in the temporal regulation of both vegetative and reproductive development
2. __floral__, [Expression level of ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 determines rice inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Expression level of ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 determines rice inflorescence form through control of cell proliferation in the meristem%5BTitle%5D)),  We previously reported that the ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1) gene, encoding an F-box-containing protein orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, suppresses precocious conversion of rachis branch meristems to spikelets to ensure generation of certain number of spikelets
3. __panicle__, [New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield%5BTitle%5D)),  Positional cloning of the gene revealed that SCM2 was identical to ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), a gene previously reported to control panicle structure, Although SCM2 is a gain-of-function mutant of APO1, it does not have the negative effects reported for APO1 overexpression mutants, such as decreased panicle number and abnormal spikelet morphology
4. __floral__, [Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate%5BTitle%5D)),  In addition, APO1 is associated with the regulation of the plastchron, floral organ identity, and floral determinacy, Phenotypic analyses of apo1 and floral homeotic double mutants demonstrate that APO1 positively regulates class-C floral homeotic genes, but not class-B genes, Molecular studies revealed that APO1 encodes an F-box protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGAN (UFO), which is a positive regulator of class-B genes
5. __floral__, [ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1%5BTitle%5D)),  Further analysis indicated that APO2/RFL and APO1, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS, act cooperatively to control inflorescence and flower development,ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 2/RFL, the rice ortholog of Arabidopsis LEAFY, suppresses the transition from inflorescence meristem to floral meristem through interaction with APO1

17. __meristem__, [Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(Rice ABERRANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION 1, encoding an F-box protein, regulates meristem fate%5BTitle%5D)),  Characterization of rice aberrant panicle organization 1 (apo1) mutants revealed that APO1 positively controls spikelet number by suppressing the precocious conversion of inflorescence meristems to spikelet meristems
18. __vascular bundle__, [A gene controlling the number of primary rachis branches also controls the vascular bundle formation and hence is responsible to increase the harvest index and grain yield in rice](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(A gene controlling the number of primary rachis branches also controls the vascular bundle formation and hence is responsible to increase the harvest index and grain yield in rice%5BTitle%5D)),  APO1 expression occurred not only in developing panicles but also in the developing vascular bundle systems, It suggests that APO1 enhances the formation of vascular bundle systems which, consequently, promote carbohydrate translocation to panicles, The HI1 allele is suggested to regulate the amount of APO1 expression, and thereby control the development of vascular bundle systems
19. __culm__, [New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(New approach for rice improvement using a pleiotropic QTL gene for lodging resistance and yield%5BTitle%5D)),  In this study, using chromosome segment substitution lines, we identified an effective quantitative trait loci (QTL) for culm strength, which was designated STRONG CULM2 (SCM2), A near-isogenic line carrying SCM2 showed enhanced culm strength and increased spikelet number because of the pleiotropic effects of the gene
